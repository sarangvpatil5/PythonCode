
Rough sketch of the program:


1.Import the required libraries: random and time.

2.Generate a random number between 1 and 100 using the random library and
  store it in the variable Number_Random.

3.Start a for loop that will run 10 times.(10 seconds are given as input)

4.In the loop, ask the user to input a natural number between 1 and 100 and 
  store it in the variable Number_Guess.

5.Check if the input entered by the user is a natural number or not.
If it is not a natural number, print an error message and continue the loop.

6.Convert the user input into an integer.

7.Compare the user input with the random number generated at the start of the program. 
  If they are equal, print a message with the number of attempts and break out of the loop.

8.If the user input is less than the random number, print a message to guess a larger number.

9.If the user input is greater than the random number, print a message to guess a smaller number.

10.Wait for one second before prompting the user for the next guess using the time library.

11.If the loop runs four times without a successful guessing number, print a message that the time is up and reveal the correct number.
